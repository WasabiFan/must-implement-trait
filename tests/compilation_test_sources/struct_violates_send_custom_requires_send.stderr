  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `(dyn NotSend + 'static)` cannot be sent between threads safely
  |
  = help: the trait `std::marker::Send` is not implemented for `(dyn NotSend + 'static)`
  = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `std::marker::Send` for `std::ptr::Unique<(dyn NotSend + 'static)>`
  = note: required because it appears within the type `std::boxed::Box<(dyn NotSend + 'static)>`
  = note: required because it appears within the type `MySendStruct`
  = help: see issue #48214
  = note: this error originates in an attribute macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
